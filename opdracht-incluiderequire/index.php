Truthfully, what is a full stack engineer is a very difficult question to answer because it's a term that has been used for years by engineers of varying skill levels to mean different things. As new trends are introduced, it causes a particular overloading to occur as full stack adopts new responsibilities.",

HTML_QuickForm provides developers with a declarative approach to defining form fields and their associated validation rules and automatically generates the necessary HTML and JavaScript code needed to display the form accordingly. HTML_QuickForm also automatically validates submitted forms as indicated and allows developers to define a function that further handles valid submissions.",

Is it the nature of the selected technology that determines implementation success, or the other way round, the hottest startups glorify the programming languages they implement? On the technology side, PHP for startups was given up for lost quite a while ago. But, while Ruby on Rails and Django advocates have been crossing swords to establish technology leadership, the PHP technology has evolved substantially in recent years. At the end of the day, PHP demonstrates incredible fitness for usage in tech startups",
